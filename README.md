This is a simple app to mint ERC-1155 NFTs to represent player accomplishments in [MetaGame](//metagame.wtf).

The permissions for each token are controlled by the existence of other tokens in the system.

One of the purposes of the system will be the curation of art. People will receive tokens that allow them to mint a single work of art. The community at large will choose who gets the chances.

Or, rather it is something like the monetary system in reverse. For the NFTs, people will be able to buy them for small amounts money. Say $1 apiece.

That $1 is potentially split differently for each token class. I think it's there's classes which there is one and then nearly limitless so long as they are released at a slow enough rate.

There are 13 teams with one apiece of 13 sets of
13 things. One of the sets is the 13-sign solar zodiac. It is based on the actual positions of the constellations relative to the plane of the Earth’s elliptic.

Currently the "month" we're in at a given time is which constellation is on the opposite side of the sun. What can we definitely not see?

I want to rotate it 180° and make the month what's directly over us.

I think there should be a standard 169 == 13² voting tokens standard per person per year. Those review submissions and choose recipients of single-use Creator tokens which gives them access to a configuration interface where they can set the characteristics for a new class. They also have permission to distribute gating tokens for their new token which can enable others to collaborate.

But it would ideally be a compendium of all digital art. With 256 bits you can enumerate the atoms in the Sun. Human history is much less dense & so long as there aren't hoarders consuming them, there's plenty of tokens.

169 per person per year time 8 billion people is 1⅓⨯10⁹ a year. 256 bits is 10⁷⁷, so we can go for 8½ years before we run out if every single person were represented in the system.

The 13 tokens would be one a piece from each of the teams. I want for the teams to have tokens representing membership. Also a token giving in proportion to time spent in the service of one of the teams.

There are 13 guilds & one's definitely a Coders'.

There are 13 major pieces of software being developed in tandem.

There are 13 colors and each month you'll vote on which team gets to claim the next month by which color you select. We'll know what tokens you have left, so we can coordinate and lots of us hold the same one back.

There are 13 Captains. For their month they hold greater executive power than the considerable amounts they generally have.

I want to set people free. I want to realistically remove the threat of incarceration, hunger, homelessness, or war. I want to drastically improve our overall safety. Certainly not by building giant walls in the desert.
